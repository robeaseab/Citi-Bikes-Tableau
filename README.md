# Tableau - Citi Bike Analytics

## Background

For this project I examined 2019 data from [New York Citi Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike) one of the largest bike sharing programs in the United States. 
The data is publicly available on the program's webpage.  See [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data).

My resulting products can be found here: [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/rob.seaberg#!/vizhome/City_Bikes/2019StartStationPopularity)


I aggregated the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to build several reports.  I chose to analyze the most recent data (first 6 months of 2019).  I used jupyter lab to import the csv files.  I then merged and reformatted the dataframes and exported the result as a csv for analysis in Tableau.  The questions I explored were: 

* What were the most popular starting and ending stations, with a static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey.

* What are the peak days in which bikes were used? 

* What are the peak months in which bikes were used so far this year? 

* Is there any correlation between trip length and age?
